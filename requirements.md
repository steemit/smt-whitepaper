Describe community growth

Founder issuance
Inflation schedule -- disinflationary
200% / year is unsustainable, 10% year is -- how to strike the balance
Incentivize new users while supporting existing users



New requirements from Ned

- High price for asset to deter scams
- $2000 USD / year
- Creation fees
- Market fees?
- Fees pool in STEEM and have to be claimed as dividends?
- Smart contract for fundraising (ICO)
- Sharedrop logic
- Return funds if insufficient or if project doesn't get off the ground


Idea:  Pay creation fee + 10% of ICO proceeds into MM balance.
